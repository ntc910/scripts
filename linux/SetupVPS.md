## How to setup Parsec, Moonlight using Tailscale
## And use a VPS as relay server to reduce latency
---
This guide will help you to:
- Resolve 6023 error on Parsec.
- Setup port forwarding in a VPS.
- Setup Tailscale to work with Parsec and Moonlight.
- Open port without modify router's config.

When do you need/follow this guide:
- Setup your PC as host for low latency game streaming.
- You can't setup Port Forwarding.
- You're not the owner of the network.
- You don't have the permission to config the network.
- You can PAY about 1-2$ per month for renting a VPS.

This guide may work with Zerotier too.

## Installation

#### Install Tailscale, Moonlight and/or Parsec

- [Install Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1347/installation)
- [Install Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki/Setup-Guide)
- [Install Parsec](https://parsec.app/downloads)</br>
Install this on both your host and client pc.

#### Now, you need to change to config file of Parsec on the host PC:
1. Exit Parsec, this is required before change the json file.
2. Open the json file:
- Press Win+R
- Insert: ``` %AppData% ```
- Open "Parsec" folder
- Add this to file "config.json" 

```
"app_custom_address": {
    "value": "<ip-address>"
},
```

The "value" is the Tailscale ip address of the host PC. Example:

```
"app_custom_address": {
    "value": "100.64.0.3"
},
```

3. Save the file and start Parsec.

- NOTE that if you want to go back to normal Parsec connection without using Tailscale, you need to remove this config.

- From here, you can connect to the host PC with Parsec without 6023 error.

#### For Moonlight

You just need to add new PC using the Tailscale ip address of the Host PC.

---

From here, both Client and Host must connect to Tailscale.</br>
After done above steps, now you can connect to the host without any error but you may face the high latency problem.</br>
Now, it's time to setup the VPS as relay server to reduce the latency.

#### Setup VPS

- You must rent a VPS (or some provider can give you a free trial).
- Your VPS must have a public IP address.
- Choose the provider that place their server on your country/ city because this will give you the lowest ping.
- Choose the lowest configuration because this don't need a high performance and this will save your money. In my case, I choose 1 CPU core, 1 GB of RAM, 100 Mbps with unlimited data usage.
- Choose the Linux as Operating System. Ubuntu is recommended.

---

Test the ping of the VPS. In my case:
```
Host PC <-> Client PC = 100ms :(
Host PC <-> VPS       = 4ms
VPS     <-> Client PC = 4ms
```

Now go to the VPS console:

- Update your VPS:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

- [Install Tailscale for Linux](https://tailscale.com/kb/1031/install-linux)
- Start Tailscale:
```
sudo tailscale up
```

- Now check the connection status:
```
sudo tailscale status
```

This is my result (I hide some information):
```
100.64.0.5      ubuntu              linux -
100.64.0.3      host-pc             windows -
100.64.0.4      phone               android -
```
While:
```
100.64.0.5  // This is my VPS address
100.64.0.3  // Host PC address
100.64.0.4  // Client PC address
```

#### Setup port forwarding in VPS

Install netfilter-persistent to save your config if VPS shutdown/ reboot:
```sh
sudo apt install netfilter-persistent -y
```

Install iptables-persistent
```sh
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```


Enable port forward
```sh
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```

Remove # in this line
```sh
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```
Press Ctrl+O -> Enter to save then press Ctrl+X

Apply
```sh
sudo sysctl -p
```

- Now forward a port to Host PC, in my case, I use port 9000:
```sh
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 9000 -j DNAT --to-destination 100.64.0.3:9000
```

In here, "udp" is the protocol. Some case it will be "tcp"</br>
"9000" is the port number</br>
"100.64.0.3" is the Host PC ip address used in Tailscale

#### For Moonlight, you need to forward the following port:
TCP 47984, 47989, 47990, 48010</br>
UDP 47998, 47999, 48000, 48002, 48010</br>

- Simply use following command:
```sh
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 47984 -j DNAT --to-destination 100.64.0.3:47984
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 47989 -j DNAT --to-destination 100.64.0.3:47989
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 47990 -j DNAT --to-destination 100.64.0.3:47990
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 48010 -j DNAT --to-destination 100.64.0.3:48010

sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 47998 -j DNAT --to-destination 100.64.0.3:47998
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 47999 -j DNAT --to-destination 100.64.0.3:47999
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 48000 -j DNAT --to-destination 100.64.0.3:48000
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 48002 -j DNAT --to-destination 100.64.0.3:48002
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 48010 -j DNAT --to-destination 100.64.0.3:48010
```
---
- Save and reload the config
```sh
sudo netfilter-persistent save && sudo netfilter-persistent reload
```
- Check if rule exist:
```sh
sudo iptables-save
```

---
Now change the port number in Parsec:
- Host PC, change the "Host Start Port" to 9000
- Client PC, change "Client Port" to 9000

Before start, you MUST change the IP address in the Parsec config file to the IP of the VPS.</br>
For Moonlight, you MUST add new computer using the IP of the VPS.</br>
In my case, it is 100.64.0.5</br>
Or you can try using the VPS public ip address, with this, Client PC don't have to install Tailscale

Start connect and check the ping.

~Good luck!
